The script will automatically patch and then run the install process for VMware
Server on Ubuntu machines.

To run the script either launch it from the same folder that contains the VMware
Server archive or supply it the path to this folder. Be careful to run the
script as a superuser and take care not to supply a folder path that contains
spaces in it.
