 How to
    1. Download VMware Server (2.0.1 or 2.0.2) – gz format, not rpm. Whichever
    version you choose, keep the license key near.
    2. Run the script with super user rights either in the same folder where you
    have downloaded the server archive, either by providing it the path to that
    folder. The script will download the needed patch from my server. Make sure
    the folder where you have downloaded the server’s archive doesn’t contain
    spaces in its path name or the script will exit (giving you this reason as
    an error message). If the script exists, it will give you a decent warning
    from which you should be able to tell what’s wrong. On Ubuntu at least, the
    VSOCK module will not work (will fail to compile), giving you a hint that
    your kernel sources might not be the ones for your running kernel. This is
    not true, as the script takes care of this before doing the hard work.
    Anyway, VMware Server will work without it.

    Example on how to run the script:

    chmod +x vmware-server-2.0.x-kernel-2.6.31-14-install.sh
    sudo ./vmware-server-2.0.x-kernel-2.6.31-14-install.sh [PATH _TO_VMWARE_ARCHIVE]

    4. When you are asked about adding users to the server, if you do not
    provide your own account, the user used for loging in the web console of the
    server will be root (maybe you should add yourself there).

    5. Provide the license key when asked about it.
    
    6. For the ones installing Windows guests in VMware Server, you must pick
    one of the following two solutions to avoid having problems with the mouse
    in the console:
        * you run this script in the terminal every time you want to launch a
        VMware Server console, but after you have installed the VMware plug-in
        for Firefox
        * you export this variable in the environment right after login such
        that it will be set before starting Firefox:
            VMWARE_USE_SHIPPED_GTK=yes
